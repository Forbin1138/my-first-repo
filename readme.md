# Nick Kavanagh

## Intro

100% disabled veteran teaching myself coding/electronics.
Currently studying bash, regexp, python, micropython with esp32/8266 boards.
I use linux distributions for all my computers and probably know exactly enough to be stupidly dangerous to my systems.
If you use one of my programs, check it carefully.
